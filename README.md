## API Documentation Course

```shell
# will also build if local images not there, otherwise it will build from local images
docker-compose up
docker-compose down
# this is to rebuild images, rarely need
docker-compose up --build

# restart one container, handle if make a change locally
docker restart api-documentation-course-swagger-editor-1

```

Log openapi into swagger editor.

<!-- ## Update postman

Find docker host IP:

```shell
docker info
``` -->

## Manual instructions

# README

## Prerequisites

## Swagger Editor

https://hub.docker.com/r/stoplight/prism

```shell
npm i swagger-editor
```

### Install Prism

View docker docs:
https://hub.docker.com/r/stoplight/prism

```shell
docker pull stoplight/prism
docker run --init --rm -v $(pwd):/tmp -p 4010:4010 stoplight/prism:4 mock -h 0.0.0.0 "/tmp/openapi.yml"
```

Docker compose:

Use prism as part of a docker compose file to aid development environment portability:

```shell
version: '3.9'
services:
  prism:
    image: stoplight/prism:4
    command: 'mock -h 0.0.0.0 /tmp/api.oas3.yml'
    volumes:
      - ./api.oas3.yml:/tmp/api.oas3.yml:ro
    ports:
      # Serve the mocked API locally as available on port 8080
      - '8080:4010'
```

Local:

```shell
npm install --global @stoplight/prism-cli
# Print usage info for testing
prism --help
```

### Run Swagger UI

https://hub.docker.com/r/stoplight/prism

Pull the docker image:

```shell
docker pull swaggerapi/swagger-ui
```

With the command below, the current working directory ($(pwd)) on the host machine will be mounted to the /tmp directory inside the container. This allows you to access files in your local working directory from within the container. The Swagger UI running inside the container can then access the Swagger/OpenAPI specification file (`openapi.yml`) located in the mounted directory.

```shell
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -e PORT=8000 -v $(pwd):/tmp -e SWAGGER_JSON=/tmp/openapi.yml  swaggerapi/swagger-ui
```

### Run Swagger Editor

To use the docker image in DockerHub:

```shell
docker pull swaggerapi/swagger-editor
```

Run the following command to start a container based on the swaggerapi/swagger-editor image, and the Swagger Editor interface becomes accessible in your web browser at http://localhost. You can then edit your Swagger/OpenAPI specification file (swagger.json) using the Swagger Editor running inside the container. Any changes you make will be reflected in the mounted volume (./swagger.json) on your local filesystem.

```shell
# docker run -d -p 80:8080 -v $(pwd):/tmp -e SWAGGER_FILE=/tmp/openapi.yml swaggerapi/swagger-editor
docker run -d -p 80:80 -e PORT=80 -v $(pwd):/tmp -e SWAGGER_FILE=/tmp/openapi.yml swaggerapi/swagger-editor

# can create a script that makes running this simpler:
# would need to stop the container.
# docker run -d -p 80:80 -e PORT=80 -v $(pwd)/chapters:/tmp -e SWAGGER_FILE=/tmp/ch1.yml swaggerapi/swagger-editor
```

This will run Swagger Editor (in detached mode) on port 80 on your machine, so you can open it by navigating to http://localhost in your browser.

## Run mock server using Prism

```shell
prism mock -p 8080 ./openapi.yml
prism proxy -p 4040 api/openapi.yaml http://localhost:8080/
```

## Mongo DB

Start a mongo server instance

```shell
docker run --name pos-db -d -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest
# pos-db-new is the name of the container
docker run --name pos-db-new -d -p 3306:3306 mongo:latest
```

Docker-compose

```yml
# Use root/example as user/password credentials
version: "3.1"

services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo
    ADD  MORE IN THE FILE
```

Install in API server
npm install mongoose --save

#### Going it the DB container

Go into container

```shell
# list containers
ps
# add container ID
docker exec -it dcaa3e60df81 bash



```

#### Add path to mongosh binary for session

```shell
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/bin/mongosh"
# Connect via. Mongosh:
mongosh # connects to mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
# Commands here: https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/cheat-sheet/#connect-via-
show dbs
# prints the current database
db
# use the pos-db.
use <database_name>
```

DONT DO
Alternatively add it to bash_profile/rc

```shell
# Go it current working directory and the bashrc should be there:
cd ~
ls
# Add the Directory to PATH:
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/usr/bin/mongosh"' >> ~/.bashrc
# Alternatively open the file with nano
# install nano to edit bashrc later:
apt-get install nano
nano .bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
# test mongo cli:
mongosh --version
```

=======

Alternatively, provide the path to the mongo distributable in the command.

#### Query the database

```shell
use my_database

db.createCollection("users")

db.users.insertOne({ name: "John Doe", age: 30 })

db.users.find()

db.users.updateOne({ name: "John Doe" }, { $set: { age: 31 } })

db.users.find()

db.users.deleteOne({ name: "John Doe" })

db.users.find()

show dbs
```

NoSQL booster for mongoDB:
mongodb://localhost:27017

### MYSQL DB

```shell
docker exec -it d94610e86026d84090e74daa2a6e1e9f0e2c1256b9de18277bd3b9860cad41fc bash
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/bin/mariadb"



# Connect via. Mongosh:
mongosh # connects to mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
# Commands here: https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/cheat-sheet/#connect-via-
show dbs
# prints the current database
db
# use the pos-db.
use <database_name>
```
