# API Documentation Course

Welcome to the API Documentation course! This repository contains everything you need to test and document the course API.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a local API development environment, providing all the necessary components to develop, test, and debug an API on your machine. Here, you'll find everything you need to work with the course API—referred to as the POS API (Point-of-Sale API). The repository includes a frontend interface, an API server, and a MongoDB database, along with other essential tools.

As we progress through the course, you'll interact with various parts of this repository.

## System Privileges and Course Setup

A _personal computer_ is required to complete these setup instructions.

To fully participate in the course, it's essential that you have administrative privileges on the machine you’re using. These privileges allow you to install software, run scripts, execute commands, and set up development environments. Many work computers, especially those not configured for developers, restrict these capabilities. Therefore, it’s highly recommended to use a _personal computer_ for the course to ensure you can complete all tasks without restrictions.

If you only have access to a work computer while taking the course, send an email to [mark.wentowski@docsgeek.io](mailto:mark.wentowski@docsgeek.io) to discuss the available options.

**Note:** You only need a personal computer to complete the course exercises. A personal computer is not required during the training sessions where you'll only be viewing a presentation.

## Required Software for the Course

Search for these software applications on Google and download them:

- Discord
- Visual Studio Code
- Postman
- Google Chrome
- Docker Desktop

During a software installation, if you are prompted to create an account, do so. Ensure to provide a _personal email address_ when prompted to enter an email.

_After installing each software_, please CLOSE the software. The instructions will tell you should open a software.

If you are having trouble installing software, complete the steps in [Join the Discord Server](#join-the-discord-server) first. In Discord, post to the **Support - Software** > [# general](https://discord.com/channels/1278288408795549716/1278300529734451274) channel, or post to the channel specific to the software (preferred).

## Project Directory Structure

Take a moment to review the high-level folders/files of project and their purpose:

```sh
api-documentation-course/
┣ .vscode/                    # Contains VS Code configurations and settings
┣ admin/                      # React-based admin portal (frontend UI for the API)
┣ docs/                       # Documentation specific to setting up the repository
┣ openapi/                    # Source OpenAPI specifications and design artifacts
┣ postman/                    # Postman collection and environment files for API testing
┣ scripts/                    # Scripts used for setup automation and other tasks
┣ server/                     # API implementation (backend server)
┣ .gitignore                  # Specifies files and directories to ignore in Git
┣ .prettierrc                 # Configuration file for Prettier code formatting
┣ README.md                   # Main setup instructions and links to specialized docs
┣ docker-compose.yml          # Docker Compose file for the main project setup
┣ package.json                # Lists project dependencies, scripts, and metadata
┗ setup.sh                    # Script to automate repository setup and initial configuration
```

You might not fully understand every folder or file right now, but it's helpful to develop a basic familiarity for when instructions direct you to use specific tools in this repository.

## Creating Your Personal Directory

You shouldn't edit the files in this project, except for those in the `personal` directory. Create this directory off the root to store any files you'd like to keep untracked by Git.

## Running the Setup Script

The `setup.sh` script automates the setup of this repository by handling tasks like installing project dependencies, starting Docker, and seeding the database so the API has data ready for use.

**Prerequisites:**

- Ensure Docker Desktop is open, as the script contains Docker commands.

1. Open a terminal (For Windows, a Git Bash terminal) in VS Code.
1. Make the script executable and run it:

```shell
./setup.sh
```

If you receive any popups asking for granting permissin for some program to make edits to your machine during the set up process, go ahead and grant permission and the script will continue running.

If the script fails or you encounter any error messages in the terminal, please copy the entire output and post it in the appropriate **Discord** channel based on your operating system:

- [# windows-setup](https://discord.com/channels/1278288408795549716/1278591699186090028)
- [# mac-setup](https://discord.com/channels/1278288408795549716/1278591744459669535)

Optionally, read and report on the messages that were outputted to the terminal and note the ones where issues arose.

## Verifying Docker Containers

After running `setup.sh`, open Docker Desktop (if not already open) and navigate to the **Containers** tab. You should see a high-level container named `api-documentation-course`. Expand it to view the sub-containers.

- Ensure each sub-container shows "Running" status.
- Check that each port in the Port(s) column is a clickable URL. If any port isn't clickable or any container isn't running, reach out on Discord for help.

If all containers are running, and the ports are clickable, you're good to go! So the instructor can verify Docker is configured properly, take a screenshot. In a future step, you'll post it to Discord (more on that later).

If either two of the approve conditions are not met, please post your issue (using the template) to the [# docker](https://discord.com/channels/1278288408795549716/1278304522522988649) Discord channel.

## Running Admin Panel

The Admin panel is a frontend CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) application that uses the ocurse API on the backend to retrieve and manipulate data.

1. Open a _new_ terminal in VS Code (use Git Bash if you're on Windows).

2. Run the following script:

```shell
./scripts/run-admin.sh
```

3. If the script runs successfully, a link to the Admin panel will be displayed. Click the link or visit [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to view the admin panel in your browser.

So the instructor can verify Docker is configured properly, take a screenshot of the Login screen (or any screen). In a future step, you'll post it to Discord (more on that later).

When you're finished viewing the admin panel, stop the server by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the same terminal where you ran the script.

## Pulling Changes

Occasionally, updates may be made to the repository, and you'll need to sync these changes with your local version. The instructor will notify you in the [# repo-updates](https://discord.com/channels/1278288408795549716/1278608354469609525) Discord channel with specific instructions on how to pull the latest changes.

**Tip:** Keep an eye on the #repo-updates channel for announcements!

## Soliciting Reviews

The Discord server also includes a Get Feedback category where you can request feedback on your work. Each course exercise has its own channel under this category. Post a link to your work for others to review.

## Postman Setup

For detailed instructions on configuring Postman for this course, please refer to the [Postman Setup Guide](./docs/postman-setup.md).
