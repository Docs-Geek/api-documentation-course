# Use cases

### 1. **Food Ordering Applications**

- **Application**: These are customer-facing platforms, such as mobile apps or websites, where patrons can browse restaurant menus, customize their orders, and complete the purchase process.
- **Use Case**: The application handles menu display, order placement, payment processing, and order confirmation. It often includes user accounts for order tracking and loyalty features.
- **Real-world Example**: Apps like DoorDash, Uber Eats, or a restaurant's proprietary app.

### 2. **Kitchen Display Systems (KDSs)**

- **Application**: These are digital systems used in restaurant kitchens to streamline the process of managing incoming orders. They replace traditional printed tickets or verbal communication.
- **Use Case**: The KDS displays real-time order details, helps staff prioritize tasks, and tracks order progress to ensure efficient workflow. This reduces errors and improves the speed and accuracy of preparing meals.
- **Real-world Example**: Systems like Toast KDS or Square for Restaurants.

### 3. **Admin Applications**

- **Application**: These are backend platforms used by restaurant managers or administrators to maintain and control various aspects of the business.
- **Use Case**: Admins use these applications to set and update menus, manage user accounts (e.g., for waitstaff or kitchen staff), adjust pricing, and configure promotions. The platform may also include analytics tools for monitoring sales and performance.
- **Real-world Example**: Restaurant management systems like Clover or admin dashboards for proprietary restaurant software.

Each of these applications plays a distinct role in the restaurant ecosystem, from customer interaction to behind-the-scenes order fulfillment and administrative control. Would you like examples of technologies or platforms that power these applications?
