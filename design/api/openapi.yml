            The server logic applies to the response body as follows:

            - The default `priority` is `3` out of `5`, indicating medium priority. Restaurant staff may adjust the priority based on factors like preparation time.
            - The `status` is set to `received`. Restaurant staff update the status as the order progresses toward completion.

        Each `ingredient_id` should refer to an ingredient currently in the system. For each ingredient, set the value of `is_essential` to `true` if the ingredient is required to prepare the dish. It's considered a best practice to ensure that each essential ingredient has a positive quantity. This helps determine if the dish should be selectable in the user interface.
