# Class #1: In-Class Exercises

We are going to practice sending API requests directly in the browser. You will retrieve a specific joke based on a category of your choice.

1. Go to [https://api.chucknorris.io/](https://api.chucknorris.io/).
2. Click "Retrieve a list of available categories". Remember, you can click the links directly from the website.
   1. Click the Pretty-print checkbox to make the code more readable.
   2. Copy a category from the JSON response. You only need the category text, not the quotation marks.
3. Click the link "Retrieve a random Chuck Norris joke from a given category."
   1. Replace `{category}` in the URL with the category you copied previously and hit Enter.
   2. Copy the `url` from the response, excluding quotation marks. The URL will look like: [https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/xyz](https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/xyz).
4. Paste the URL copied previously into the browser's address bar and hit enter to view the webpage for that specific joke.
5. Copy the specific joke and paste it into the chat.
