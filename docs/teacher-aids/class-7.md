# Class #7: Teacher Aid - In-Class Exercises Preperation

In these exercises, you'll use Swagger Editor to document the POST `/auth/token` path of the Course API. You'll enhance the OpenAPI spec by adding informal descriptions to improve clarity and usability.

## GitHub Codespace

1. Go to [https://github.com//codespaces](https://github.com//codespaces) and sign in to GitHub if you are not already logged in.
2. Click the Codespace you created previously to open it.
3. Make the API server public. Refer to [https://api-course-docs.redocly.app/dev-setup#make-the-api-server-port-public](https://api-course-docs.redocly.app/dev-setup#make-the-api-server-port-public) for instructions.
4. Copy the Server URL:
   - Hover over the API Server (Port 80), right-click, and select **Copy Local Address**. Paste the local address into a text file, such as one created using Notepad or another text editor.
5. Start the server by running `npm run start` in a terminal. Refer to [https://api-course-docs.redocly.app/dev-setup#start-the-api-server](https://api-course-docs.redocly.app/dev-setup#start-the-api-server) for additional guidance.
6. In a new terminal (click the plus icon on the right), run `npm install` to install the latest version of the API.
7. Go back to the Ports tab. Hover over the row for Port 8080 and click the Globe icon to open Swagger Editor in a new tab in your browser.
