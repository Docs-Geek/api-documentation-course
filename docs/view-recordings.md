# How to Access Your Session Recordings on MeritHub

**1. Check Your Email Invitation**
Look for an invitation to join MeritHub in your inbox.

- If you don’t see it, check your spam folder.
- If it’s still missing and you’re using a work email, your company’s firewall may have blocked it. In that case, please send me your personal email so I can resend the invitation.

**Note:** You’ll need to join MeritHub in order to view session recordings.
