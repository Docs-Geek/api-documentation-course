## Swagger UI

**1. Access Swagger UI:**

- Open the port serving the `swagger-ui` container to access Swagger UI.
- The file being served in the course repo is openapi.original.yml

**2. Understanding the Interface:**

- Swagger UI renders the API documentation based on the OpenAPI file `openapi.yml` located in the `api-documentation-course/pos-openapi/api` folder.
- You'll find a link to the `openapi.yml` file, allowing you to view the raw JSON data used by Swagger UI.

**3. Interactive Features:**

- Swagger UI provides interactive features such as the "Try it out" option, enabling users to interactively test API endpoints by modifying parameters and request bodies.

**4. Response Handling:**

- Explore example values and schemas provided for responses, aiding in understanding data structures and constraints defined in the OpenAPI specification.
- Schemas for reusable components are displayed at the bottom, offering quick access to schemas referenced in the OpenAPI spec.

**5. Conclusion:**

- Swagger UI simplifies API documentation by providing an intuitive interface to visualize and explore API endpoints, parameters, and responses.
- Its interactive features enhance the testing process, allowing users to modify request parameters and bodies directly within the UI.
- By leveraging Swagger UI, developers can gain insights into API functionality and ensure adherence to API specifications.
