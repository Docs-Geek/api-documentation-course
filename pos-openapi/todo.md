## Todo:

Server steps:
DONE Connect postman api to your server generated api not the other one
DONE Run Prism in a proxy mode, where the tool sits in between the client and the server.
DONE prism proxy -p 8081 api/openapi.yaml http://localhost:8080/

====

DONE Pagination
DONE Move use cases out of OpenAPI into 'best-practices-by-endpoint"
DONE Database schema
DONE Security schema

Read book:
DONE generate api server using swagger codegen
preesntation open source tool try creating template.
api workflow spec
api styleguide using spectral -- maybe also render this

## Maybes:

DONE rename operations
Docusaurus so you can add tabs, also supports api docs
Response headers, how do clients use?
Staff user roles that can change specific statuses?
They would need a way to login to the KDS
tools for updating descriptions in code annotations
user login to change details, maybe use clerk.

## Ports

May want to run everything from the API server instead of the separate OpenAPI repo.
or you have a course folder with a Docker file.

ports:
Swagger Editor: 80:80
Swagger UI: 8000:8000 -- needs to be based on the server-generated file. the api server spins up swagger ui. need to separate it from the API server? --- but its good they are connected

Prism proxy - 8081 --- Prism ignores the OpenAPI servers element
API server: 8080

on API server:
npm run start

prism proxy -p 8081 api/openapi.yaml http://localhost:8080/

Change baseUrl in Postman to the proxy 8081

MongoDB: 27017:27017‚Å†
