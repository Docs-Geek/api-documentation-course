## Security Best Practices

When integrating OAuth 2.0 for your applications, adhering to security best practices is crucial to ensure the safety and integrity of your system and user data. Below are key areas to focus on:

### Token Storage

Securely storing tokens is vital to prevent unauthorized access. Recommendations include:

- **Mobile Apps**: Use secure storage mechanisms like iOS Keychain or Android Keystore.
- **Web Applications**: Store tokens in HTTP-only cookies to prevent access via JavaScript, mitigating XSS attacks.

### Token Rotation

Regularly rotating tokens reduces the risk of long-term token exposure. Best practices include:

- **Short-Lived Tokens**: Use short expiration times for access tokens.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Implement refresh tokens with strict expiration policies and invalidate them if suspected of being compromised.

### Use HTTPS in Production

Using HTTPS encrypts data in transit, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Ensure:

- **SSL/TLS**: Always use SSL/TLS certificates for encrypting HTTP traffic.
- **Enforced HTTPS**: Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS and use HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to enforce secure connections.

### Instructions

1. **Identify the Status Code**:

   Locate each status code in the template and find a response that includes that code. Review its details, especially the **Error Title** and **Error Description**.

2. **Recreate the Error**:

   Using a tool like Postman, replicate the conditions that generate this status code by intentionally breaking the rule that triggers it (e.g., using incorrect request parameters or an invalid JSON body).

3. **Capture the Response Body**:

   Once the error response appears, copy the response body, including key fields, and paste it into the **Error Response Body** section of the template.

4. **Outline Resolution Steps**:

   Using Postman, attempt to correct the error by applying the appropriate fix (e.g., correcting parameters, adjusting the request body). Observe the steps you took to resolve the error.

5. **Document Resolution Guidance**:

   Based on your solution in Postman, describe the necessary **Resolution Steps** to resolve the error in the template.
