When integrating OAuth 2.0 for your applications, adhering to 
security best practices is crucial to ensure the safety and 
integrity of your system and user data. Below are key areas to focus on:

*Token Storage*

Securely storing tokens is vital to prevent unauthorized access. 
Recommendations include:

- **Mobile Apps**: Use secure storage mechanisms like iOS Keychain or 
Android Keystore.
- **Web Applications**: Store tokens in HTTP-only cookies to prevent 
access via JavaScript, mitigating XSS attacks.

*Token Rotation*

Regularly rotating tokens reduces the risk of long-term token exposure. 
Best practices include:

- **Short-Lived Tokens**: Use short expiration times for access tokens.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Implement refresh tokens with strict expiration 
policies and invalidate them if suspected of being compromised.

*Rate Limiting*

Enforcing rate limiting policies helps protect your API from abuse 
and ensures fair usage. 

Considerations include:

- **Request Limits**: Define the maximum number of requests per time unit 
(e.g., per minute, hour).
- **Penalty Mechanisms**: Implement penalties such as temporary bans for
exceeding rate limits to deter abusive behavior.

*Prevent CSRF Attacks*

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks can be prevented by:

- **CSRF Tokens**: Include anti-CSRF tokens in forms and verify them 
on the server side.
- **SameSite Cookies**: Use the `SameSite` attribute for cookies to 
restrict cross-origin requests.

*Use HTTPS in Production*

Using HTTPS encrypts data in transit, preventing eavesdropping and 
man-in-the-middle attacks. 

Ensure:

- **SSL/TLS**: Always use SSL/TLS certificates for encrypting HTTP traffic.
- **Enforced HTTPS**: Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS and use HSTS 
(HTTP Strict Transport Security) to enforce secure connections.
