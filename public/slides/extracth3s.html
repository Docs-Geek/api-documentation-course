        Account sign-up and obtaining API keys are part of user
        interface documentation rather than core API documentation.

    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5></h5>
      <p>
        This process is typically included in the documentation for the
        overall platform, especially if it offers both software and
        APIs.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5></h5>
      <p>
        In the documentation, it's important to detail how API
        consumers, making purchasing decisions, create accounts and
        obtain their API keys using the user interface.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">

        The buyer journey starts when a developer discovers an API, for
        example, through a Google search.

    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5></h5>

        They then navigate to the API producer's marketing site to learn
        about platform benefits (often marketing material, not technical
        docs).

        Some companies make their tech docs public, while others
        restrict access (e.g., behind payment walls), as decision makers
        often require technical details to make informed choices.

    <!-- <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">

      Companies generally provide a user interface frontend for using

      </div>
      <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5></h5>
      <p>
      If support integrations are lacking or if internal tools are

    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">

        Account sign-up is usually free, often starting with a limited

    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">

        After signing up, users are typically directed to an API portal.

        For paid APIs, access is controlled through an API portal where
        API usage is monitored and controlled.

    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5></h5>
      <p>
        An API portal serves as a centralized platform or website
        gateway to a collection of APIs.

    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">

    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5></h5>
      <p>
        The Basic plan, for instance, has lower API call costs due to
        fewer features, while higher-tier plans offer more features with
        increased costs per API call.

Each endpoint in the API has a specific Path that identifies the resource 
you want to interact with. For example, if you want to create a new resource

In this case:
- **POST** is the HTTP method used to create a new resource.
- **`/items`** is the Path for the endpoint where you interact 
with a collection of resources.

To form the complete URL for this request, you would combine this Path with 
the Base URL. For instance, if your Base URL is `https://example.com/api/v1`, 
the full URL to create a new item would be `https://example.com/api/v1/items`.

### Authorization Endpoint

POST `https://api.example.com/oauth/authorize`

### Token Endpoint

POST `https://api.example.com/oauth/token`

## Authorization Code Flow with (PKCE)

The PKCE flow enhances the security of the Authorization Code 
flow by using a Code Verifier and Code Challenge to prevent 
authorization code interception attacks. It provides a robust 
mechanism for securely handling authorization codes, especially 
in public clients, while also supporting CSRF protection.

To obtain an access token using this flow

1. Authorization Request

The API client:

- generates a Code Verifier.
- creates a Code Challenge from the Code Verifier.
- sends the user to the Authorization Server with the Code Challenge.

```shell
GET /authorize?response_type=code
&client_id=client_id
&redirect_uri=https://client.example.org/cb
&code_challenge=E9Melhoa2OwvFrEMTJguCHaoeK1t8URWbuGJSstw-cM
&code_challenge_method=S256
&state=xyz
```

2. User Authenticates: User authenticates and authorizes the client.

3. Authorization Response: Authorization Server sends an authorization 
code to the client's redirect URI.

4. Token Request:

Client sends the authorization code, Code Verifier, and other 
required parameters to the token endpoint.

```shell
POST /token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code
&code=authorization_code
&redirect_uri=https://client.example.org/cb
&client_id=client_id
&code_verifier=dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk
```

5. Token Response: Authorization Server validates the Code Verifier 
against the Code Challenge and issues an access token.

### Unauthorized Client

HTTP Status Code: 401 Unauthorized

```shell
{
"error": "unauthorized_client",
"error_description": "The client is not authorized to 
request an authorization code."
}
```

1. Check Client Credentials: Verify that the client ID and secret 
are correctly configured and have the necessary permissions to 
request an authorization code.
2. Review Client Registration: Ensure that the client application 
is properly registered with the authorization server.
3. Verify Scopes: Make sure that the requested scopes are allowed 
for the client.
4. Review Authorization Server Policies: Confirm that the authorization 
server policies do not restrict the client from making the request.
5. Contact Support: If all configurations are correct and the issue
persists, contact the authorization server support team for further 
assistance.



### Access Denied

HTTP Status Code: 403 Forbidden

```shell
{
"error": "access_denied",
"error_description": "The resource owner or authorization server
denied the request."
}

1. Check User Permissions: Ensure that the user has the necessary
permissions to access the resource.
2. Review Authorization Request: Verify that the authorization 
request is correctly formed and includes all required parameters.
3. User Consent: Ensure that the user has granted consent for 
the requested scopes and access.
4. Authorization Policies: Check the authorization server's policies 
to see if there are any restrictions or conditions that might 
cause access to be denied.

## Security Best Practices

When integrating OAuth 2.0 for your applications, adhering to 
security best practices is crucial to ensure the safety and 
integrity of your system and user data. Below are key areas to focus on:

*Token Storage*

Securely storing tokens is vital to prevent unauthorized access. 
Recommendations include:

- **Mobile Apps**: Use secure storage mechanisms like iOS Keychain or 
Android Keystore.
- **Web Applications**: Store tokens in HTTP-only cookies to prevent 
access via JavaScript, mitigating XSS attacks.

*Token Rotation*

Regularly rotating tokens reduces the risk of long-term token exposure. 
Best practices include:

- **Short-Lived Tokens**: Use short expiration times for access tokens.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Implement refresh tokens with strict expiration 
policies and invalidate them if suspected of being compromised.

*Rate Limiting*

Enforcing rate limiting policies helps protect your API from abuse 
and ensures fair usage. 

Considerations include:

- **Request Limits**: Define the maximum number of requests per time unit 
(e.g., per minute, hour).
- **Penalty Mechanisms**: Implement penalties such as temporary bans for
exceeding rate limits to deter abusive behavior.

*Prevent CSRF Attacks*

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks can be prevented by:

- **CSRF Tokens**: Include anti-CSRF tokens in forms and verify them 
on the server side.
- **SameSite Cookies**: Use the `SameSite` attribute for cookies to 
restrict cross-origin requests.

*Use HTTPS in Production*

Using HTTPS encrypts data in transit, preventing eavesdropping and 
man-in-the-middle attacks. 

Ensure:

- **SSL/TLS**: Always use SSL/TLS certificates for encrypting HTTP traffic.
- **Enforced HTTPS**: Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS and use HSTS 
(HTTP Strict Transport Security) to enforce secure connections.

        When users encounter the "unhappy path," the documentation

        While OpenAPI’s error schema is a common standard, many APIs
        have their own error schemas designed to be more helpful to
        users of that specific API.

    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">

        Conceptual and procedural documentation should address these
        API-specific errors, particularly those related to specific
        resources.

    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">

      <p>
        For instance, documenting a standard
        <code>404 Not Found</code> error isn’t necessary in conceptual
        and procedural docs since it’s a common issue with an obvious
        source.

        However, with a payment processing API, if a card payment is
        declined, it’s essential to interpret the response fields to
        determine the next steps.

    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5></h5>

        These steps could include displaying a message to the user to
        contact their card issuer or attempting the payment again later.

    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
