        Database models are structured representations of the data
        architecture for a database.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">

        They define how data is stored, organized, and manipulated
        within a database system.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <p>
        There are several types of database models. For our purposes, we
        will focus on the Entity-Relationship (ER) Model.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5>Structure</h5>
      <p>
        Data is represented using entities (objects) and relationships
        between those entities.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5>Example</h5>
      <p>
        A school database where students, teachers, and classes are
        entities, and the relationships define which students are in
        which classes and which teachers teach which classes.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5>Distinct existence</h5>
      <p>
        Entities have their own identity and can be uniquely
        distinguished from other entities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: Each student in a school database is a unique entity.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5>Entity types</h5>
      <p>
        Entities are grouped into entity types, which define a set of
        entities with the same attributes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: All students in a school form the "Student" entity
        type.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5>Primary Key</h5>
      <p>
        Each entity type has a primary key, an attribute (or a
        combination of attributes) that uniquely identifies each entity
        instance. Example: The student_id attribute in the "Student"
        entity type serves as the primary key.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5>Relationships</h5>
      <p>
        Entities can be related to other entities through relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: A "Student" entity might be related to a "Course"
        entity through an "Enrollment" relationship, indicating that a
        student is enrolled in a course.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5>Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams</h5>
      <p>
        They provide a visual representation of the entities (or tables)
        in the database and the relationships between them.
      </p>



      Cardinality specifies the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with the number of instances of another entity. It defines the minimum and maximum number of occurrences of one entity that can be linked to the occurrences of another entity in a relationship. Cardinality is often indicated using symbols such as "1" (one), "M" (many), or "*" (zero or more).










    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5>Relationship types</h5>
      <p>
        Understanding the types of relationships and how they are
        depicted in an ER diagram is essential for designing a robust
        and normalized database schema.

      <ul>

          <p>
            <b><u>One-to-One (1:1)</u></b>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Definition</b>: Each entity associates with only one
            entity in another set.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Example</b>: Each patron has one unique loyalty card;
            each loyalty card is tied to only one patron.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Definition</b>: One entity in a set links to multiple
            entities in another set.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Example</b>: A patron places multiple orders; each order
            belongs to one patron.
          </p>
          <p><b>Notation</b>: <code>PATRON ||--o{ ORDER</code></p>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Definition</b>: Multiple entities in each set relate to
            multiple entities in the other set.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Example</b>: Dishes appear in multiple menus; each menu
            includes multiple dishes. Usually resolved with a junction
            table like MENU_DISH.
          </p>
          <p><b>Notation</b>: <code>DISH ||--|{ MENU</code></p>
