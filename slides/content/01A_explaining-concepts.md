Conceptual topics are often grouped under a section called "About the REST API." 

This section provides essential background information to fully understand and use the API effectively.

The "About the REST API" section offers a thorough introduction.

This includes an overview, key concepts and terminology, common use cases, software architecture, authentication details.

It is crucial for systematic developers who need a complete understanding of the API’s capabilities before diving into technical details. 

It is also valuable for opportunistic developers who explore links to "learn more" about related concepts.

This section helps them evaluate whether the API is suitable for their needs or organization.

This section primarily explains "what the API is," focusing on concepts rather than step-by-step instructions. 

However, it includes task-oriented topics, like those in Authentication and Authorization, that involve practical steps.

Previously, we defined the topics for the "About the REST API" section during our documentation planning.

## Use cases

Use cases illustrate specific scenarios where the API can be leveraged effectively to address real-world business challenges.

Each use case presents a particular business problem, often depicted through a visual flow diagram.

The supporting text identifies the issue or conflict. 

The key focus is on demonstrating how these challenges arise in real-world situations and how the API can resolve them.

The section begins by outlining the problem through a visual flow, highlighting the pain points or inefficiencies in the current process. 

Following this, an updated flow diagram is presented.

The diagram shows how the API integrates into the process to solve the problem, leading to a positive outcome.

### Key Characteristics of Use Cases

Use cases describe scenarios and solutions that the API can address without delving into technical details. 

The emphasis is on showing how the API's application leads to successful resolutions in real-world situations.

They demonstrate the broader impact of the API, making it clear how its use can drive positive outcomes. 

This helps all stakeholders, both technical and non-technical, to grasp the potential benefits and applications of the API.

By focusing on the broader application and benefits, use cases show how the API can solve specific business problems.

## Resource Descriptions

The Resource Descriptions section in API conceptual documentation serves a distinct role compared to reference documentation. 

Looking back, we learned that reference docs dive into technical specifics—such as endpoints, request/response formats, and field-level details.

A "resource description", on the other hand, is part of the conceptual documentation.

It provides a broader understanding of how API resources are derived from domain models.

And how they map to real-world entities.

This section is rooted in the domain models previously developed during the "Collecting source material" phase.

It connects real-world concepts to API resources by mapping these models directly to the API's structure.

**Conceptual Alignment**: 

Explain how the API's resources align with real-world domain concepts.

Demonstrate how the structure and relationships within the API reflect the domain's inherent logic and entities. 

For example, a "Customer" resource in the API mirrors the customer entity in the business domain.

- **Resource Significance**: 
- 
- 
- 

Highlight the importance of each resource within the domain, discussing its role in the API.

This includes its impact on business processes, and how modifications to these resources can influence overall system behavior.
  
*Example*: 

For example, discuss the role of a resource (e.g., "User") in the API.

To this by emphasizing its significance in the business process and what happens when its attributes are changed.

### Resource Analysis

<!-- - **Key Fields and Their Significance**:  -->

Present the resource object independently of specific requests. 

Rather than listing all fields, highlight the most critical attributes that represent the core characteristics of the resource. 

Explain the importance of these fields, what they represent in the domain, and their potential use cases for developers.

*Example*: Identify key fields such as "Order Date" or "Customer ID" in an "Order" resource.

Explain these fields are central to the resource's function and how they should be used in different scenarios.

- **Relationships and Associations**: Describe how resources interrelate. 

For instance, detail how a resource might reference another resource by ID, and explain the nature of this relationship. 

Discuss any decisions around relational modeling, such as using embedded resources or references. 

Explain the resource's relationship to others including parent-child relationships.

Or, touch on the broader associations like One-to-One (1:1), One-to-Many (1:N), and Many-to-One (N:1) as established in the domain model and ER diagrams.

<!-- *Example*: Explain how an "Order" resource includes a "Product ID" and "Customer ID," discussing how these associations are structured and how they impact the data relationships within the API. -->

### Link to technical details

Link to the API reference for technical specifics, such as endpoints, request/response formats, and field-level details.

### Authorization Endpoint

POST `https://api.example.com/oauth/authorize`

### Token Endpoint

POST `https://api.example.com/oauth/token`

## Authorization Code Flow with (PKCE)

The PKCE flow enhances the security of the Authorization Code 
flow by using a Code Verifier and Code Challenge to prevent 
authorization code interception attacks. It provides a robust 
mechanism for securely handling authorization codes, especially 
in public clients, while also supporting CSRF protection.

To obtain an access token using this flow

1. Authorization Request

The API client:

- generates a Code Verifier.
- creates a Code Challenge from the Code Verifier.
- sends the user to the Authorization Server with the Code Challenge.

```shell
GET /authorize?response_type=code
&client_id=client_id
&redirect_uri=https://client.example.org/cb
&code_challenge=E9Melhoa2OwvFrEMTJguCHaoeK1t8URWbuGJSstw-cM
&code_challenge_method=S256
&state=xyz
```

2. User Authenticates: User authenticates and authorizes the client.

3. Authorization Response: Authorization Server sends an authorization 
code to the client's redirect URI.

4. Token Request:

Client sends the authorization code, Code Verifier, and other 
required parameters to the token endpoint.

```shell
POST /token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code
&code=authorization_code
&redirect_uri=https://client.example.org/cb
&client_id=client_id
&code_verifier=dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk
```

5. Token Response: Authorization Server validates the Code Verifier 
against the Code Challenge and issues an access token.

1. Check Client Credentials: Verify that the client ID and secret 
are correctly configured and have the necessary permissions to 
request an authorization code.
2. Review Client Registration: Ensure that the client application 
is properly registered with the authorization server.
3. Verify Scopes: Make sure that the requested scopes are allowed 
for the client.
4. Review Authorization Server Policies: Confirm that the authorization 
server policies do not restrict the client from making the request.
5. Contact Support: If all configurations are correct and the issue
persists, contact the authorization server support team for further 
assistance.



### Access Denied

HTTP Status Code: 403 Forbidden

```shell
{
"error": "access_denied",
"error_description": "The resource owner or authorization server
denied the request."
}

```
1. Check User Permissions: Ensure that the user has the necessary
permissions to access the resource.
2. Review Authorization Request: Verify that the authorization 
request is correctly formed and includes all required parameters.
3. User Consent: Ensure that the user has granted consent for 
the requested scopes and access.
4. Authorization Policies: Check the authorization server's policies 
to see if there are any restrictions or conditions that might 
cause access to be denied.
5. Retry or Contact Support: If the issue cannot be resolved through 
configuration checks, retry the request or contact the support team 
for assistance.

When integrating OAuth 2.0 for your applications, adhering to 
security best practices is crucial to ensure the safety and 
integrity of your system and user data. Below are key areas to focus on:

*Token Storage*

Securely storing tokens is vital to prevent unauthorized access. 
Recommendations include:

- **Mobile Apps**: Use secure storage mechanisms like iOS Keychain or 
Android Keystore.
- **Web Applications**: Store tokens in HTTP-only cookies to prevent 
access via JavaScript, mitigating XSS attacks.

*Token Rotation*

Regularly rotating tokens reduces the risk of long-term token exposure. 
Best practices include:

- **Short-Lived Tokens**: Use short expiration times for access tokens.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Implement refresh tokens with strict expiration 
policies and invalidate them if suspected of being compromised.

*Rate Limiting*

Enforcing rate limiting policies helps protect your API from abuse 
and ensures fair usage. 

Considerations include:

- **Request Limits**: Define the maximum number of requests per time unit 
(e.g., per minute, hour).
- **Penalty Mechanisms**: Implement penalties such as temporary bans for
exceeding rate limits to deter abusive behavior.

*Prevent CSRF Attacks*

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks can be prevented by:

- **CSRF Tokens**: Include anti-CSRF tokens in forms and verify them 
on the server side.
- **SameSite Cookies**: Use the `SameSite` attribute for cookies to 
restrict cross-origin requests.

*Use HTTPS in Production*

Using HTTPS encrypts data in transit, preventing eavesdropping and 
man-in-the-middle attacks. 

Ensure:

- **SSL/TLS**: Always use SSL/TLS certificates for encrypting HTTP traffic.
- **Enforced HTTPS**: Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS and use HSTS 
(HTTP Strict Transport Security) to enforce secure connections.
