## Recipes

Recipes are different from functionality topisc, they tpically involve the demo of multiple functionalities to statisy a speicfic use case. They are of information type task.

**From API Functionality to Recipes**: API functionality forms the building blocks for recipes, providing the necessary endpoints and actions for users to accomplish their tasks.

### Recipes:

- **Practical Implementation**: Recipes provide step-by-step instructions for accomplishing specific tasks or workflows using the API. They often involve multiple API endpoints and actions coordinated together.
- **Example-Centric**: Recipes focus on providing concrete examples of how to use the API for common tasks or scenarios, demonstrating best practices and recommended approaches.
- **User Journey**: They guide users through practical implementation, demonstrating how different API components interact to achieve a desired result.
- **Example**: A recipe detailing how to authenticate a user, retrieve their order history using API endpoints, and display it in a user-friendly format.

<!-- ## TAG / GROUPING / FOLDER

Can be thought of a use case or cookbook.

  **Use case**

These can be thoguht of a use cases. the use cases come directly from the API introduction.

then underneath are the concepts, functionalities, recipes, references, and best practices (i.e., rules) related to the use case. Micro content. CLassify your own microcontent.

So they are used to group a series of topics.

Use case topics are CONCEPT type information type.

tag/
┣ 00_tag-overview.md
┣ functionality-1.md
┣ functionality-2.md
┣ recipe.md
┗ reference.md

- **Definition**: Use cases describe scenarios in which the API can be used to solve particular problems or achieve specific business objectives.
- **Focus**: They provide a high-level view of how the API can be applied in different contexts and industries. So could be online payments vs. in person payments, maybe one or boht apply to someone. Or it could be mobile app vs. web app development.
- **Example**: A use case might describe how an e-commerce platform can use the API to manage inventory, process payments, and track shipments, whereas a nother section is for ar etail store that needs to process in-person payments.

**Cookbooks**  - dont call cookbook

- **Definition**: Cookbooks are collections of related recipes and best practices for using the API. They provide comprehensive guides on how to use the API for various tasks and scenarios.
- **Focus**: They offer a broader, more organized approach to using the API, often including multiple recipes and techniques grouped by theme or functionality.
- **Example**: A cookbook might include sections on user authentication, data manipulation, and integrating third-party services, with recipes for each section.


## Exploring functionalities:

What is API functionality:

Translate fucntioanal requirements to functionalities:
https://www.notion.so/Identify-functionalities-1535eb7a44484747a1146dc0bc60fd04

Functionality template:
https://www.notion.so/Example-functionality-template-fe8e6b68da754d6e8860e5a653cc9551

demonstrations how to use specific API functions or features, typically using code samples to demonstrate
They focus on individual API calls or small sets of related calls, showing the syntax and usage in a clear, concise manner. It's like honing in on a speciifc functioanlity to see the different options. Recipes are different, they tpically involve the demo of multiple functionalities to statisy a speicfic use case.

A code sample might show how to make a GET request to retrieve user data or how to use a specific endpoint to update a resource.

Staretically use concepts.

  Includes best practices.
  The documentation site is more than just api docs, its also how to do things using a dashboard (CRUD operation). So 
  it integrates software and API docs.
  Signing up for accounts
    Make it about the sales journey - wjat is this called? Get from marketing. consider beginning journey.
    Sometimes there's a sandbox. Sandbox account.
  May already dobe: Auth: Show basic request structure. For example, differences with authentication/auth methods.
  STRUCTURE:
    Get started / quick start
    Functionality grouping #1
      The grouping is actually just a tag. Maybe contrast the conceptual tag vs. the reference tag.
        Reference tag is usually the plural of the resource.
        The tag in teh conceptual docs is about the functioanlity, that involves the actions taken one or more resources, or what the result of interacting with that resource produces.
      Maybe look back at cookbook when talking abotu functionalities.
        A cookbook is a group of recipes.
      Good to do based on functionalities, tasks developers need to accomplish. The functionality name.
      Functioanlity grouping is just a label, somewhat arbitrary. Its like a tag.
    FOLDER: Functionality grouping #2 - Template
      These are of information type CONCEPT.
      Folder click - Functionality group escription:
        Tagline/summary of functionality -- Learn to do...
        Description of functioanlity.
        Block links to the different..
        Diagram?
      FILE - FUNCTIONALITY:
        So this usually involves one endppoint targetting one resource, vs. a recipe is a use case combining.
          So its just a functionality demonstration.
            ****It's kind of like the range of examples possible in the Finix;***
          So examples are the basis of it. What situation would you use each example? Show the relevant code sample.
            They focus on a specific resource showing all the different options, filters you can use to do different things.

            Not sure if i should look at the course API specifiically:
            https://www.notion.so/The-course-API-s-query-components-b731736054f948149b5bac9ea99b1009

            How to use query params to achieve a result, for example.
            Including specific fields for a specific situaton (like for a recurring payment to have a trial period).
            So you are achieving a goal, but its like a microgoal.
            The API reference just shows the example with a labelw hat the example means but it doesnt descirbe why you would use the sample (i.e., request) in what situations. The examples in API refernece are more exhaustive, showing the minute possibiltieis, but perhaps the concepts guide can only highlight the important parts to achieve the different thigns.

        So this can be purely concept, or mix concept with step-by-step (functioanlity).
            The strategic use of concepts comes into play here.
        It can actually be a CONCEPT page. The structure of concept page is hard to pin down.
        Or a FUCNTIOANLITY. Should we call it a recipe in this case?
            NO, functioanlity. A functioanlity 
        When UI, minimize screenshot use - UIs go out of date. Instead, bold for UI text.

        Also incldue din functionalities sections are best practices. Best practices for preventing...
          Rule
          Good / Bad example
        Can include reference information types, like tables. https://finix.com/docs/guides/after-the-payment/disputes/dispute-states/ß
        Receipes can also be part of these functioanltieis sections, but you want to separate talking abot them.

        Realization:


    General - styleguide:
        Refer to resources in docs with backticks `Resources`, with link to API reference `Resources`[API] -- create a css for that. Its just a purple link box with the word API inside it.
        Highlight important fields in request and response bodies.
    ***Usability of docs - maybe separate section:
        Go back over your presentation to draw out these important bits.
        Maybe draw on website design princirples.
        Right navigation
