      <h5>Limitations of swagger documentation</h5>
      <p>
        Understanding an API solely through a Swagger document can be
        challenging due to its limited scope.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <p>
        Using Swagger documentation alone may lack critical context, such as the
        API's purpose, audience, and business goals.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <p>
        Additionally, practical usage examples demonstrating interactions with
        the API might be absent.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5>Gathering comprehensive information</h5>
      <p>
        To fully understand the API, gather and refine information from diverse
        sources.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <p>
        As an API writer, your role involves gaining a deep understanding of the
        API's intended use cases and target audience.

    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5>Focus on User Requirements</h5>
      <p>
        This understanding enables you to anticipate user needs and preemptively
        address potential challenges in the documentation.

      <p>
        This will allow us to write documentation that is user-centered,
        comprehensive, and effectively communicates how to use the API within
        its intended context.

      <h5>Simulated Startup Scenario</h5>
      <p>
        Through a simulated startup scenario, you'll create source content for
        API documentation, gaining valuable insights into its conceptualization
        and design decisions.

      <p>
        Before designing the API, the team must select an API development
        approach.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <p>
        Three main approaches guide the process: API Design First, Code First,
        and API First
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5>API Design First</h5>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Methodology: Design and specify the API before coding, defining
          endpoints, request formats, etc., using languages like OpenAPI.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advantages: Clear blueprint, better documentation, consistency, and
          early feedback. .
        </li>
        <li>Drawbacks: Initial time investment and potential overdesign</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5>Code First</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Methodology: Develop the API directly in code, generating
          specifications and documentation afterward.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advantages: Faster initial development and immediate coding start.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drawbacks: Inconsistent documentation, less design focus, and
          retrofitting specifications.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5>API First</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Methodology: Design and develop the API before other components,
          emphasizing it as a primary interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advantages: Consumer-driven, modular development, and consistency.
        </li>
        <li>Drawbacks: Initial complexity and time investment.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <p>
        API First isn't <em>really</em> an API development method. It's more
        like a corporate objective.
      </p>
      <p>It can be used with either Code-first or Design First methods.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <h5>Summary</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>API Design First</b>: Detailed design before coding, ensuring
          well-thought-out design and comprehensive documentation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> Code First</b>: Quick development starting with code, potentially
          leading to inconsistencies or less polished designs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>API First</b>: Treating the API as the central component, promoting
          consumer-centric design and modular development.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
      <p>
        Each approach has its place depending on project requirements, team
        structure, and priorities, significantly impacting the resulting API's
        efficiency, maintainability, and usability.
